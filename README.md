# DataSphere_Challenge

This was a very good challenge for me, it made me really problem solve and spend time on all elements of a web application. I learned a lot. I haven't dealt with a lot of JSONP http requests because most of the apps that I built send and receive normal json data. I now see why JSONP	is a normalized way to send json data with. Oddly enough, I had to name the callback 'JSON_CALLBACK' in my url string otherwise it threw another error. I wish I had time to do the bonus section, I would basically use the jQuery end of page event and then increment the page number in the url and make another call with that to the api. Then I would push those new 10 results into my array of stores on the scope. 

I would love to hear feedback regarding this project. You can clone this repo run a ```npm install``` from terminal and open ```localhost:3000``` in your browser and it will make the first api request and dynamically populate the html.
